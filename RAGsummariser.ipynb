            "it's saying now 4 does not have a left child I know if there is nothing here there will be nothing here also because it is the nature of the tree simple that's it let me just code it not to think about it okay let's just code it so these sorts of problems that deal with like the structure and stuff don't think about it no need to think just follow the steps and wherever you get stuck try to see how you can get not stuck okay I start with the root node initially I will just say if root is equal to equal to null return null not a problem so I will say initially my left most node is equal to root so I'll say node left most is equal to currently root now I will say while left most or if y leftmost dot neck dot left is not equal to null okay while left most dot left is not equal to null because of the nature of the tree what am I going to do I'm going to say okay my I'm going to Traverse this level current is going to be equal to well first of all it will be left most node current is equal to left most now while current is not equal to null because this is automatically pointing to null so if I'm keeping moving forward traversing level wise while current is not equal to null what am I doing I'm adding I'm saying current dot left I'm hoping you can see this pointer that I am moving I'll zoom in a little bit I'm saying current dot left dot next is equal to current dot right current dot left dot next is equal to current dot right after that I will move forward to the next level next node in the same level for that I need to connect the two nodes over here these two so I will say if current dot next is not equal to null I will say current dot you're seeing what we are doing right we're traversing level by level and while we're going level by level we are connecting the level below it one by one like a chain so before moving forward I need to connect this bridge so I will say before moving forward current dot write dot next I'm getting the linked list feeling is equal to current dot next three dot left no need to think this is connected after that I will say current is equal to current dot next since then this whole entire level will be over after this while loop so after this while loop level is over when level is over you go to the new level means you start again from the left most left most is going to be equal to what left most is going to be equal to what the previous left most left previous left most was to then it will be the left of that left most is equal to previous left smooth start left okay it's asking me to return the node okay asked just return the root node return the root node it's fine that's what it that's what it is asking hopefully that should work good question submit oh syntax error sorry submit bracket error only yeah be its hundred percent of java Solutions and memory is also nice beats 75 percent of some submissions very cool it's a very efficient solution um pretty nice root um bracket like this easy peasy very simple okay moving on to the next question this is a good question very nice good question but still easy for you because you know breakfast search next question again the most easiest question nothing you have to do this one is literally copy pasting this was asked in Amazon and Flipkart so if you're interested in joining Amazon or Flipkart very easy question from what I have seen from what I have noticed Amazon questions are the most easiest ones correct me if I'm wrong but you can see tag has companies so simple you are given the binary tree prints the right side means if you look at the binary from right hand side this is nothing this is just level order reversal and just get the last element of every level how simple is that it's very simple so when you're traversing entire level you know we get the level size then just get the level size last one that's it last element I'll just copy paste copy paste actually I'll I'll write it down no problem let's say we take this one Right View I just take this and we copy paste this is actually very simple I don't even have to make the diagram for this okay so here list it says list of integer okay not a problem this is all looking good Q is added level size is added I don't need average Q dot pole like I'm removing from the queue and I'm adding in the queue as well not a problem if I comes to be the last element in the in the in the level what will be the last element I will be equal to level size minus 1 because that is the last time the loop will run I will just add it in my result result dot add the current node dot value what uh I am I'm trying to not say anything negative but is this really a what kind of questions are these companies asking I I it's actually like especially in India Amazon base pay what is it tell 12 LPA such unworthy questions and people are like crazy about such companies which is fine but why like whenever I hear someone say I'm an Amazon coding interview I'm very scared it's just so funny especially in India and like I don't know it's just this is one of the Mysteries I will never understand it's very upsetting that people don't know the reality to Fang interviews and the salary packages but anyway do what you like is what I always say these questions I don't know why you think it's difficult maybe something is wrong with me but anyway let's move forward see simple question okay next question also very simple next question is saying that you are given a binary route only and two nodes of tree X and Y which are integers as you can see here in the function definition you have to return true if the nodes are cousins otherwise false cousin means of the same lineage like same level but they should not have the common parent same level but parent should not be common not a problem I can just find these two nodes and if these two and I can find the level of these two nodes so just find the nodes find the level of the nodes and um find if they are siblings that's it so if they are not siblings and they are on the same level then they are cousins you can do it by a bet for search as well you know you can get the element like this for breakfast search like you can get all the levels right but then in the level how will you make sure that uh you're not taking siblings for example for 2 and 3 you can search in the level do 2 and 3 exist in the same level yes but they are siblings so how can you make sure actually what you can do is for such questions you can just we can make a make a function that just checks whether these two are siblings or not and um yeah sibling means common parent so cousin will be bought cousin will be equal to level of X should be equal to level of Y and X and Y should not be siblings okay let's do that okay here I'll paste is cousins right so in order to search for this thing um this is currently given in integer I need to get it as I'll create a find node where I will pass root and X similarly I will get the Y naught root n y I will say return I will say the level should be same so I can create a level method which gives me the level I will pass root XX in the current level I'll pass zero you know how to find the level right we have done this before should be equal to if you're not familiar with what I'm writing right now like what is how to find node how to find a level go go watch the tree lecture number one in that I have explained this implementation in detail so I will say root YY initial level 0. so this one and this one I'll be like are these two equal so whenever I am checking every level you know what I'm doing right we know for now that in a queue after every level is done traversing I know that Q will contain all the elements in the next level so here I know that I'm checking 2 and 2 what are some of the ways via which it can be like false so if let's say you are having two nodes let us say left and right left node and right node if left let's say or write any one is equal to null then answer is false that's an obvious one if both left and right are null then I can just skip because it may be true that in the future in the ahead of this level I may have something no no not all the left and right like this no no we're talking about mirror so left and right I mean this one this is what I meant this is null this is null okay I got it so we are trying to check level by level but instead of adjacent resistance we will check mirrors so we will check this one like um the the end ones so I'll start checking this one and this one then for the next level I will check this with this and this with this then for the next level I will check this with this this with this this with this this with this ah okay that is how we can solve it but now the problem is how do we make sure because in the queue I cannot get elements from the middle so how do we make sure when we are checking these two they are together these two they are together okay how do we make sure that let's see I'm just thinking out loud so bear with me I I don't even know how to solve this so I'm just just imagine okay that Kunal doesn't know how to solve this and he's given a question in interview so far I know so if you are given two nulls let's say this is null this is null then I know I can skip it because it may be possible that somewhere other somewhere else we will have like different ones so 2 and 2 is fine let's say it will be like is 2 and 2 equal yes it is okay I will remove two I will add three and four remove two add four and three now it's going to be like check three and three but I can't get this three I can only eliminate from the first okay then I will not add left and right as it is when I remove two I will just say what order do we need it in we need three three four four so I will add left dot left first then right dot right first then left dot right right dot Left 4 4 make sense now you can check three three should be same yeah so I will remove three three and then I will add again left left dot left first right dot right first yeah got it then left dot right first right dot left first six six yeah now we're getting it now we're getting it yeah okay cool one more thing is previously we were skipping null like skipping adding null in the queue this time we will not because you know of this case five three three eight eight headlight check null with it these one is null so answer is false because we need it to be symmetric okay very simple uh check and then add in this order left or right right dot right left dot right sorry left or left right dot right so add it in this order first left of left right of right then left off right and right of left so thought process clear how I approached it I was like what is given to us I know BFS will be used I use BFS I found myself in a problem I need to check from corner corner and move inside but it was actually not storing in corner corner so instead I use this approach to store now I can just code it okay I will copy this my symmetric okay and here what we're going to do is it's a tree node of type integer so I'll just copy paste QQQ just do whatever we did on the Whiteboard and here I'm saying I will not add my root I will just add first of all root of left and root of right Q dot add root dot left Q dot add root dot right please I have explained it using multiple examples my thought process work with what you are given see the obvious things identify the pattern start solving it you will get stuck solve that stuck how to solve three problems and linked list also okay then I will just say check well while Q is not empty while not Q dot is empty okay I will add the this thing left left right right left right right left after I have removed both so once I remove I'll need to store it somewhere you know because I'm not like okay remove this and then add no I can't add left and right I will add left first and then right first so while I can remove it it's fine but I will just store it in another node Q dot remove Pole so now I have left and right removed I will check now if left and right are equal to null either like this or this or this or this then just skip it continue if either of these are null if let's say one is null and one is not null then break no not break return false if any one of these is null because you know what we are doing right these adjacent elements that we have in the queue are actually the mirror positions hope that makes sense how are we maintaining the mirror positions this this these four the way we are adding it again inside okay another position if uh if these are not equal if let's say we say left dot val is not equal to write dot value then also it is not mirror if none of these return false return true but we have to add as well now add left left right right so Q dot add left dot left right dot right left or right right dot left should be very simple to understand oh by the way this is node so it won't have generics here because Q is giving me node only tree node type so I can just store it here I should look fine let me copy paste and submit oh it added two semicolons I'm very bad at typos looks good accepted easy to understand simple stuff right Google what's the time complexity o of n because we are traversing every node only once and we're using Q so space complexity is also of n okay that was it okay so that was breakfast search we did some nice questions and now any question that is given to you that uses bad for search you'll be able to do it okay second topic also the most important it's probably more important than BFS can't really compare but like both are important but this one has a more interesting questions if you will and this one is called depth first search opposite of refer search breakfast search your level by level depth first search is top to bottom let's get started so there are many ways by which you can do traversal up to down which is depth first and we've already done this in the past so if you see the first video of you know the buying research trees I believe we have done this already we have done uh three types of such traversals pre-order in order and post order so pre-ordered reversal we know we have something like a b pre-ordered reversal is Plus then a then B in order to reversal it is first a then Plus then b means left and right if you don't want to talk about A and B we can talk about left and right left right left right left right and then post order means plus left then right then node so what is the meaning of this thing what do you mean by traversing like this it's pretty simple basically means that um we are first going to if we talk about let us say pre-ordered reversal which is this one we are first going to visit the root node for example and then we are going to visit all the left trees and then all the right trees recursively we have done this in the past okay so it's all about the ways in which you are exploring the tree so here we're saying node first then left and then right so if I talk about a tree let's say we talk about a tree and I say simple tree like uh we have 10 over here then I have 12. one will come out as a function stack so this has returned one now two is live okay left I have gotten one I can assume that all the children of left are also reversed now it will be like okay three it is your turn three will be do the same thing three will go over here left and right null null swap three will be returned also three will be returned also now 2 will be like coming at 2 function stack please watch the recursion playlist this two means I'm in the two I'm working with two right now two will be live okay left I have right I have one and three I will swap these okay swap it swap it three one swapped and after that returned root means return two two will come out of the function stack see I'm explaining you in detail every single thing 2 will come out of the function stack so 2 is sub whenever something comes out function stack I know that it's tree is internally what are the subterries were they are already reversed now four will be like okay I have come out of line 29 here this line 29 now it will call the right tree for the right tree 7 will go inside then 6 will go inside 6 will be swapped it will be removed the 9 will go inside nine will set then 7 will be like okay six and nine I have swap it so 9 here 6 here same thing as it happened in the left hand side 9 here 6 here 7 will be like okay done return root 7 will be returned 7 will come out of the function stack now four will be like okay two and seven I have to swap so it will swap two and seven and you can see we will get this thing this thing second one two and seven swapped so internally also swapped okay two and seven swap four seven two internally it's already swapped nine six three one is this not the mirror yeah done four will come out of the function stack returned from where it was called which was what main function stack over program over easy okay now what is the time complexity o of n because n number of nodes and we are only visiting it once space complexity is what because we are using recursion so what is the maximum number of items that we can have in recursion at once we know that when it's calling left or right this is actually I have mentioned I think 100 times in the recursion playlist that the maximum height of the recursion stack is always equal to the height of the recursion tree okay so height of the tree no at so for example this will refresh your memory at no point of time any two nodes means more than one node at the same level will be in the recursion tree at once hence the maximum height of the recursion tree maximum number of calls in the recursion tree at once will be the height of recursion height of the original tree so space complexity is O of H or o of log n because that is the height of the tree please study get serious these things I have color covered already but I'm still explaining again again again anyway move forward next question okay next is another question from Google maximum depth of binary tree thumbs up the way I find questions for you people is I see the companies that were asked before and the ones that have the most thumbs up on lead code so I just make a list I also add these to the assignments so you can check out our link GitHub Link in the description below so all the assignments ah given the root of the binary return of Maximum depth okay a binary is maximum that has a number of nodes along the longest path from the root node to the leaf no I am not doing this question I am now getting frustrated this is a Google question and so many thumbs up what is happening we have to do some good level questions otherwise I will go mad I am not doing this question this is too easy okay I can literally speak the code maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node to the leaf node okay from the root to the leaf maximum path I will assume again again post order I will assume left has the most one or right has the most one take the maximum and do plus one simple try to code it on your own pause this video and code it on your own but if not then I can do it no problem it won't take long okay I hope you tried it but I believe this is one of the easiest question I don't know why I put this over here it's actually a waste of time it's our waste of time that we're doing this question but still I'll do it very easily uh like very fast okay because it's a waste of time so you know we've done better questions like this so yeah again uh we did the height one right the diameter similar to that so I'll be like if root is equal to equal to null then just return 0 then it will like okay number of nodes so maximum nodes I say okay get the number of like get the depth for the left hand one and the right hand one okay left is equal to what max depth for the left and max depth for the right then what is the so I have gotten left and I have gotten right then for the node that I'm currently at so see post order left first right first then for the current node now for the node I'm currently at what is the depth math dot Max off left comma right plus 1 and I will just return that for that answer similarly it will return for this answer this answer it will return in the end this answer recursion we don't want to spend much time on this submitted beats hundred percent of java users very simple question okay moving forward all right next question by Facebook again too many thumbs up convert sorted array to binary search tree okay good question uh easy question uh we have done AVL trees before so you can do it with that but that's fine but there's a simpler way to do this I'm not going to solve this question because because I solved it throughout in the very first video of trees so if you remember if you don't remember go watch right now I created a function or method method called from sorted array so we took mid and we did all those things I explained it clearly in that and I did all the diagrams and everything dry ran of the code as well debugging examples walkthrough everything code running um convert array array to bind research yeah and sorted array to binary search tree yeah we did this lecture number one watch it I'm not going to do this one okay moving on all right next question I found on lead code and also from a previous company Facebook now called meta now we have done the I'm not doing any more easy questions otherwise I will lose my mind okay it doesn't matter which company they were asked in Easy questions are not worth your time now we have seen the binary search binary easy questions is that just a joke so we are going to move up a little bit let's do some medium questions so medium question 11 000 thumbs up very good asked in Facebook nice this will be fun now my energy is back up so let's see given the root of the binary tree flatten the tree into a linked list okay okay binary is given you have to convert that into a linked list or a skewed binary tree you see this one so it's just converting the structure into this many ways to do it pre-order in order post order but it is asking me to convert it in pre-order reversal what is pre-order if I am at the root node I will do things at root node first then I will go in the left and then I will go in the right isn't that what pre-order is right if you see over here in my iPad pre-order do the things at root node first don't be like okay give me left give me the answer right give me the answer then I will do it no that is post order we done some questions on that already pre-order here it's saying root node I am at one particular node I will solve it on that node and then I will solve downwards meaning when you are solving the problem on that node it may be possible that the down will not already be fixed okay solving left first right first and then I'm doing the current node it means what down left and right are already fixed now fix the current node okay solving current node first then left and right means the current level is solved after that I will go down and solve left and right in order left node right means left subtree is solved then I will solve with the current node whatever I have and then I will solve the right part most of the time you use um what do you use most of the time that I have seen post order but it obviously depends on the question so we I already again bar many many times I'm explaining you the thought process how to pick the approach so when you're given this question okay I have to convert it into a skewed tree uh um it's saying in pre-ordered reversal okay so whenever you're given questions like this in big tech companies try to come up with a bad solution first tell them the time complexity space complexity and then they will ask you okay can you optimize it and then do a little drama and be like oh yeah yeah I can optimize it like this so let me tell you the bad solution first and then we will try to optimize it so bad solution it's a good question um I will just to take the lead code example only it's a good example so Facebook if you know depth per search you know that it's saying pre-order traversal so we know depth search is being used so half problem is solved now how to actually do this thing so you are given one two five three four six approach number one is normal pre-order two its very simple it's saying do pre-order traversal and create a tree so what you can do is normal pre-ordered reversal normal pre-order traversal as you Traverse store nodes in a queue so that I can use the first in first out in the end remove from q1 by one and make linked list Simple Solution if we are doing what it is asking us to do in order to reversal okay no problem I will do in order traversal an odd reverse will be one in order means what node then left then right so node means I am at one yeah I will work with one first then I will go in the left two I will work with two first then I will go in left three I will then go four then I will go to Five yeah I will plus five then six so one two three four five six foreign I will take items one by one out of Q if I take one out of the queue I will put one over here one dot left I will just say null right I will say is equal to the next item in the queue which is 2. okay node.value should be if it is less than equal to whatever we have then yeah it will give you the error for example let's say we have we have 9 here so you'll be like hey is the node.value uh like greater than equal to high it should not be then return false otherwise keep moving forward very simple record this really quick okay what is the space and time complexity recursion o of n uh visiting every node one time complexity of an space complexity open okay so good question not bad but still not that I'm not happy with it that much valid binary search tree I'll just call another one called helper I will pass the root and I will just part Nalan Nal so I will say public Boolean helper function zoom in a little bit hide the files so you can see clearly now okay node node integer low it should not go lower than this I will show dryer and also again so don't worry right if node is equal to equal to null that means return true okay it is binary no problem good binary search tree now I will say I will check for the level I am at right now if my node dot value becomes less than the lower amount that is asked that means it is false if High Dot now if node dot value becomes greater than equal to high then also return pulse you are at a node value that node value has some limit set you're going over that so but since this is of type like wrapper class so I will say if this is not equal to null because if it is null then there is no limit you can do whatever you want if low is not equal to null and and if hi is not equal to null and and after this I will go on left and right return left should be true right should be true so I will say Boolean left tree is equal to Boolean I will do the right tree as well both should be balanced I will say helper I will say node dot left when you're going in left low is not changing but there is a upper limit upper limit is now being set to the current node.value helper helper now low will be current node.value no Dot right current node.value I will not change and these both should be true left tree and right tree both should be true copy paste submit again hundred percent faster than all submissions so good very fast very easy simple dry iron is very easy currently is six null no it's not I'll be like these two things will not be taking place because both are null after that left tree as you can see this is the condition similarly it will come keep fulfilling the conditions like this this condition will be no upper limit lower limit six lower limit six upper limit ten so on and so forth if it never returns false it will keep returning true and and so true true true true true true true true true true easy okay so very easy we discuss space and time complexity also it is very simple this sort of recursion we've already done multiple times this is a pre-order and uh well technically we are also doing like um like after we're getting up that's fine yeah it's good Computing at the current level then doing left and right three the next question asked in Amazon lowest common ancestor of a binary tree let's take a look lowest common ancestor what is lowest common ancestor definition on Wikipedia is saying given find the lowest common ancestor of two given nodes in a tree okay two nodes are given oh thank God it's given in the node type tree node it's good I don't have to find nodes then sometimes they give it in numbers then you have to search and do whatever but anyway the lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and Q as the lowest node in the tree that has both p and Q as descendants where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself okay and I have given five and one five and one lowest common ancestor will be three yeah that's true three example number two it's saying five and four five and four lowest common ancestor will be 5 because a node can be an ancestor of itself it's very easy 2 and 0 will be what what is the lowest common node that both 2 and 0 are children of or grandchildren or for whatever three so you know we are going up to up to down or something so depth for search hint given 50 solution done so we know DFS will be used so that's it DFS will be used so how do we approach this thought process think about it pause this video try to do it yourself then I will tell you okay so let's take a look at this question is actually very easy now because 50 question is solved I can see from the pattern that you know depth search will be used so let's try that let's say I am doing the same tree how will we use step first search so my iPad here three five one I will not rush I will tell you my thought process for now my thought process is I know depth first search will be used that I know because that's the way we are going we are going down so that was such okay this is fine and here I can see that um I am given let's say node 5 comma 8. left and right answer three total answer three yeah good easy only thing you have to figure out you are given this list how do you find all the possible parts all the possible Parts how do you find that that is going to be tricky so a good question good question but let's at least to the basic one so here I will say int count parts node node int sum that is required and I will say a list of let's say I create in a list of integers with my current path I say new linked list then I will say return helper node sum path Intel per node node in sum okay if node is equal to equal to null no path exists zero otherwise I will take this number and add it in the path since I have passed this as a reference so any change I make will change the original one I'm not creating copies that's why I need to do backtracking so many basic concepts are being used here path dot add node.value after that I'll say int count is equal to 0 and sum is equal to 0 like how many paths can I make how many paths I can make I will calculate it here but after that I can just say count plus equal to helper of node.left sum path Plus helper of node Dot right sum path so whatever answer you're getting from left and right count plus equal to that is the answer but when you return the path before you return count you have to backtrack because I'm not creating copies of path list it is the original one being used so that's why backtrack path dot remove last one so path slot size minus one how many parts I can make that I have to calculate how many parts I can make that I have to calculate um since I am I am coming from top to bottom okay so I had I had something like this over here see I am coming from top to bottom so one two three two two one two three two two I am going to start from this side so two two I'm not going to start from one two three because that is already being checked I have done that already that is from where I am coming from so I'll start it checking from the lower bottom so 2 2 not again start from one that doesn't make any sense hope that is clear because I already had one two three so why would I want to start from one to three again no I'll start from behind two two three two one for that I can create a list iterator list iterator you can check the list uh video or you can just check the documentation it's just easy I can just say ITR is equal to path Dot list iterator so I can now iterate open it so I can say while it has a previous so iterator dot has previous I'm going to say okay there is a previous over here so path sum that I have over here plus equal to the iterator Dot previous okay and if this sum that I have becomes equal to equal to the oh no I can't have it as sum I will have it as s is equal to equal to the sum that I have provided so while means 2 plus 2 so now 2 plus 2 4 is this 4 equal to the 4 that I have provided yes then count plus plus okay that's it done yeah that's the question so the main question now is what is the space and time complexity um space complexity can be height should be fine now but we are also taking this thing o of n uh or of like in the worst case row of height in the best case but again in the best case or worst case if we talk about time complexity then n for the recursion and this internally in the worst case if the tree is not balanced can take n so N squared is the worst but if it is a balanced 3 then this will be height see it's going till the height which is log of n so n log n if the tree is balanced N squared if the tree is not balanced time complexity space complexity o of n worst case o of log n best okay done that that was it that was the question simple easy okay cool now another similar question is that this is the last one that we do because it's uh we have done almost every single concept so you are good to go for trees interviews but make sure you practice otherwise you are good to go now that was the main motivation I had some typos here and there but you can fix it okay one more question let me move forward let's do the same question but instead of counter give me all the parts please leave us alone what are you doing why are you complicating things so much that's how you study you are able to solve one question try to improve it okay what if I change this thing what if the interviewer says don't give me the number of Parts print all the parts let's make it more complex save every path in a list of list but think about it is it any different here you're taking a counter instead of taking counter just put it in a list just put it in a list so I can say copy so logic will be same but I'll put it in a list put in a list okay so I will create a list of list first of all parts okay list of list this will be find paths create a helper which will have a node sum my path and my entire the paths so that I can add it in the main answer okay but I have to have a current path also new linked list new error list think it'll be arraylist arraylist it should be arraylist okay um arraylist don't know why I took English okay no problem so you can see logic wise nothing is different the only thing instead of count I need to return list of list I am not returning anything okay I'm oh no yeah I'm not returning anything now I'm returning it here and I will just call the helper and I will just return parts yeah helper is not returning anything it is changing the main reference variable object that we have basic object and programming okay if node is equal to null 0 I can say path dot add node value current path I don't need the count I don't need the sum how do I know that I have found the path I can say if it is a leaf node so if I'm trying to find all the parts for example let's say from the root node to Leaf node or whatever trying to find the same thing but if you want to find all the parts that are not from root to Leaf node you can use this while condition that you can do on your own as well ah but if I am saying if node.value is equal to equal to my sum and let's say if it's a leaf node dot left is equal to equal to null and no dot right is also equal to equal to null in that case in my paths I can add the answer easy so this is only for I am doing just to explain to you I wanted to explain to you list of list of that will work I think this thing should be clear to you I'm not I'm adding void over here because it is directly making change in the object created in this find paths method ok so that way I don't have to return anything it will automatically change this but if it's asking you return a list of list of all the possible possible Parts not just from the root note to the leaf node then I have already taught you that as well I have taught you that I have not skipped it you just did that it is it in an account format okay done otherwise left tree and right tree so I will say helper of node.left sum minus node Dot value path and paths this is how you know that we are not really doing anything with the other things because I'm not changing the argument in the records so it's only acting as a reference to the one in the other function it's actually very simple if you have solved my recursion assignment you will understand then write write sub to recall after this I am going to backtrack or the paths that I have right now here Parts dot remove Parts dot size minus one not returning anything that's it done that's it yeah so if you want to do not just from root to Leaf but also in the middle middle then in the same function you can add in that wild condition and it should be fine time complexity for this is what go of login space complexity as well because we have a copy that we are storing here see and the copy we are storing is of the path or n nodes so what is the maximum in a balanced tree what is the maximum path from root to Leaf node log of n total number of nodes are n so n log n space and time okay now let me show you something cool this is like the top 50 tree coding problems for interviews on gigsaw Geeks you can check out my assignment in the description as well lead code is you know like more than enough and you can see level one problems level one you all can do like this well all the levels easy medium hard on this top 50 or top 100 or top 500 no matter what people give you you now know that Kunal has taught us a few problems using that we can solve any problem height of the infinity of two trees are identical mirror of the tree I think we did this one symmetric tree did this one uh diameter of a tree check if it is balanced tree did that children some parent something something no problem check for wine research tree array to binary search tree maximum gcd of siblings we already learned about siblings so you can do gcding now largest value in each level of binary tree remember we did the what did we do the average of every level instead of average try maintaining the largest value is exact rate reversal or we did that in order successor no problem at all kth largest element in a binary we did this I told you multiple approaches for this level two check if the sub tree you can do that it's also a traversal problem single values of tree unique buying research trees in order to reversal pre-order traversal post order traversal yeah it's pretty cool stuff one thing I think I wanted to mention was that we have learned about recursion right let me show you something one thing I want to mention is that we learned about breadth first traversal and you can use recursion using you can do it using recursion also uh but I taught you the iterative approach also which is using Q and we did the depth first traversal and we did that using recursion now one thing I told you in the recursion playlist is that every recursive program that you can write you can write it in iteration also and I told you the reason because it is easy to solve problems in recursion and once you have solved it in recursion to make it more optimized you can convert it into iteration and how can we convert recursive problems to iteration using Stacks so one last thing I want to show you is depth first search using stack and not recursion and how that's going to be beneficial because we're not using Stacks so no stack overflow so let's get started let's see that it is actually very simple if I'm talking about DFS using stack so let's see how we can do that so if I have like and by the way you can convert all the questions using it but ideally I would say to keep things simple use recursion okay it's fine uh if there is a way to optimize the recursion that's dynamic programming but not all cases can be applied like for these three problems not really but if there are some problems like the string ones maze ones where you can store some sort of data I think in in some of the cases like with graphs and trees as well like most many many cases in fact so that's something for later on but I think for interview preparation type whatever I have taught in this video for Fang type interviews more than enough and highly highly optimized so don't worry about it um because we did all the questions o often no of n time space most are mostly right so it can't get better than that DP will also take extra space only but a little bit more efficient if you want to make it um depth first search using stack so tree is given 12 3
